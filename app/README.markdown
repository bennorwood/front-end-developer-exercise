# List of Deviations
    1. Width of header image is 976 pixels. Because of this, the content container that holds the navigation and content sections are forced to be as wide as the header image to avoid header image blowout. Header image could be a higher resolution (ideally be around 1200 pixels) so that the overall content container could be larger without image blowout.
    2. Dynamic content: Readme.md has accepance criteria text should read "... also in Baby Step __X__" while mockup has "... also on __this__ baby step." I just picked the mockup because it seems to flow better.
    3. Expenses is mispelled in the body copy.txt file, I used the correct spelling.
